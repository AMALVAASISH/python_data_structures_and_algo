1. Basic Setup & Syntax
Core Java Topic
Equivalent in Python
JDK setup
Python installation + venv setup
First Java program
First Python script (print("Hello World"))
How Java works (JVM, JRE)
How Python runs (interpreter, CPython vs PyPy)


📦 2. Variables, Data Types, Operators
Java
Python
Variables, Data Types, Literals
Dynamic typing, int, float, str, bool, None
Type Conversion
int(), float(), str(), bool()
Assignment, Relational, Logical Operators
Same in Python: =, ==, !=, and, or, etc.


🧮 3. Control Flow
Java
Python
if, else if, else
if, elif, else
Ternary operator
Python's one-liner: x if condition else y
switch statement
Python doesn’t have it natively → use dict mapping or match-case (Python 3.10+)


🔁 4. Loops
Java
Python
for, while, do-while
Python has for (over iterables), while
Loop control: break, continue
Same in Python
Enhanced for loop
for item in list: is standard in Python


👤 5. Classes, OOP & Methods
Java
Python
Class & Object
Same, but no access modifiers in Python
Methods, Overloading
Python supports default and keyword arguments instead
Constructor (__init__)
Equivalent to Java constructors
Stack & Heap
Python has its own memory model, handled differently


🧊 6. Arrays
Java
Python
Arrays
Use Python list, tuple, or array from array module
Multi-dimensional
Nested lists (list of list)
Jagged arrays
Same: nested lists of unequal lengths
Array of Objects
List of class instances in Python


🧵 7. Strings
Java
Python
Immutable strings
Python str is immutable too
Mutable: StringBuilder, StringBuffer
Use list or io.StringIO
String methods
Rich string methods in Python: .upper(), .split(), .replace(), etc.


⚙️ 8. Static Members
Java
Python
static variables, methods
Class variables + @staticmethod, @classmethod decorators


🔐 9. OOP Concepts
Java
Python
Encapsulation
Simulated with _protected, __private, and getter/setters (not enforced)
this keyword
self
Constructors
__init__ method
super keyword
Same in Python: super().__init__()
Naming Conventions
Follows PEP8 in Python
Anonymous objects
Not common, but possible via direct calls like ClassName().method()


🧬 10. Inheritance & Polymorphism
Java
Python
Single, Multi-level inheritance
Fully supported in Python
Multiple inheritance
Supported via MRO (Method Resolution Order)
Method Overriding
Same in Python
final keyword
No direct equivalent — can simulate via naming conventions
Object class methods
Python has built-ins: __str__(), __eq__(), __hash__()
Upcasting/Downcasting
Python is dynamically typed — no need for explicit casting
abstract class
Use abc module (@abstractmethod)


🧭 11. Inner Classes
Java
Python
Inner classes
Supported in Python (rarely used)
Anonymous inner class
Use lambdas or closures in Python
Abstract anonymous inner class
Simulated via base classes with overridden methods


💡 12. Interfaces
Java
Python
Interface
Use abstract base classes (abc.ABC)
Functional Interface
Python functions are first-class citizens
Lambda Expressions
Supported using lambda x: x + 1


⚠️ 13. Exception Handling
Java
Python
try-catch, finally, throws
Same in Python: try-except-finally
Multiple catch blocks
Use multiple except clauses
Custom Exception
Subclass Exception
throw keyword
Use raise
try-with-resources
Use with statement in Python (context manager)


⛓️ 14. Multithreading
Java
Python
Thread, Runnable
Python has threading.Thread, target=
sleep, priority
time.sleep(), no thread priorities in Python
Race conditions
Same — use threading.Lock()
Thread states
Limited visibility — handled by the interpreter
Async alternative
Python also has asyncio (like event loop-based concurrency)


📚 15. Collections
Java
Python
Collection API
Python has built-ins: list, set, dict, tuple
ArrayList
Python list
Set
Python set
Map
Python dict
Comparator, Comparable
Use key= in sorted(), or functools.cmp_to_key()


🧠 16. Advanced Features
Java
Python
Stream API: map, filter, reduce
Same: Python has built-in map(), filter(), reduce() from functools
forEach method
Python: for x in iterable:
Lambdas
Fully supported

🧭 Want to Master Python Like You Did with Java?
I can give you a Python Mastery Roadmap with:
Topics week-by-week


Hands-on project ideas (for each concept)


Practice + real-world application


Just say the word — I’ll tailor it to your goals (backend, automation, ML, etc).




To be great at Python or eventually master it, you need to go through structured layers of knowledge, from fundamentals to advanced applications. Here's a detailed roadmap divided into 7 tiers, with focus areas, concepts, and real-world project examples for each.
